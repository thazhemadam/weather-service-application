# APIs used:

* MapBox API
* DarkSky API/OpenWeatherMap API
<br>

# Trying out the Application: 

The application can be worked with <a href = "https://taz-weather-service.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
<br>
<br>

# Environment Variables:

* <b>MAPBOX_API</b>: <a href = "https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> API Access Token.
* <b>DARKSKY_API</b>: <a href = "https://darksky.net/f/">Dark Sky</a> API Access Token.
* <b>OWM_API</b>: <a href = "https://openweathermap.org/">Openweathermap</a> API Access Token.
<br>
<b> Note:</b>

DarkSky API is expected to be deprecated soon.
<br>
Thus, the code has been built such that it uses the OpenWeatherMap API when that happens.
